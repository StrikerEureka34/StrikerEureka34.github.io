## Daily Learning Journal

This website contains a day-wise record of what I study and learn.
Each entry is dated and can be accessed by scrolling or clicking on a specific day.

The purpose of this journal is:
- To maintain consistency in learning
- To track progress over time
- To reflect on understanding and gaps

All entries are written in simple language for clarity.
